    "## Paparella Results\n",
    "Paparella et. al. published results of their models only for  \n",
    "certain time-points and each model was evaluated in different  \n",
    "time point selected based on ndcg@10 value. However, vanilla models  \n",
    "hit their highest accuracy early on in training (while diversity and  \n",
    "novelty are still growing), while SMORL models hit their highest  \n",
    "accuracy much later in training process (where diversity and novelty  \n",
    "reach their maximums). This cause that diversity, novelty and likely  \n",
    "also repetitiveness of vanilla models may be underestimated.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Published and \"Published\" data \n",
    "As mentioned above, Paprella published metrics only for certain time points of training  \n",
    "process in the paper (i.e. in tables and graphs). However, authors also published code  \n",
    "with various data files including text files that contains almost time series of metrics  \n",
    "from training of model. I wrote almost as it is plain text that needs to be further processed  \n",
    "to get time series. \n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook iterates through .txt output files, processes them and provide time series of  \n",
    "accuracy, diversity, novelty and repetitiveness metrices as well as loss."
