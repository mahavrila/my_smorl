## SMORL replication preparation
This repo contains data and code for pre-processing and post-processing of data from SMORL paper

To start, you need to add youchoose-clicks.dat and youchoose-buys.dat from RecSys Challenge 2015  
to rc15_data directory. These files are too large for placing on github.

Other data files from original work that are created by processing of RecSys Challenge 2015  
datasets are in this repo. 

## Where to start
Ideal starting point is playing with data_example.ipynb to see how the data are pre-processed  
in original smorl paper (Stamenkovic et al) and looking at README_preprocess.txt to get orientation  
in various files related to original paper.

Next step is looking into clicks.ipynb.
